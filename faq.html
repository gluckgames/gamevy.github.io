            <h3>How do I open an account?</h3>
            <p>Simply download the Born Lucky application and follow the steps to open your account. If there are any problems then contact us here and we can help you with the process over the phone!</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>How do I close an account?</h3>
            <p>You may instruct us to close your account at anytime by emailing support@gamevy.com with the username or registered email details of the account you wish to close. We’ll close the account within 7 calendar days after receiving your request and we will confirm the closure of your account by email.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>How do I reopen an account?</h3>
            <p>Just email support@gamevy.com with the details of the account you wish to re-open. We will review all such requests manually because accounts closed as part of our self-exclusion or cool off policy cannot be re-opened for any reason.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Why do I need to confirm my identity?</h3>
            <p>It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to gamble. That means we need to verify the age of anyone opening a Gamevy account in order to play our real money games.<br>
            We also have a duty to comply with anti-money laundering legislation and keeping criminal money out of our games.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>What if I’m having trouble confirming my identity?</h3>
            <p>Don’t worry! We use a third party identification service and sometimes a question comes up for perfectly understandable reasons. In that case we will contact you to perform a manual check which might involve sending us scans of your documents or answering further questions. We will always keep your information completely private and we’re happy to help you through the process.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>What about someone assuming my identity?</h3>
            <p>We take security really seriously – and so should you. Use a strong password (one which combines non obvious letters and numbers in different cases) and change your password on a regular basis and never disclose it to any third party. You can change your password at anytime through the My Account section of the web site. We will never ask you to disclose your password.<br>
            You can access and amend your own individual account information by clicking on “My Details” in the My Account section of the web site. If you have any reason to believe that your individual account information may no longer be secure please contact Customer Support.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>How do I withdraw my money?</h3>
            <p>Simply go to your account and select the ‘Withdraw’ funds button. Be aware that bonuses will often have wagering requirements attached before winnings can be withdrawn.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>I can’t withdraw my money – what’s happening?</h3>
            <p>There might be several reasons for this! We have an audit process that checks all withdrawals automatically and selects some withdrawals for a manual check. Please bear with us if this is the case – we’re just ensuring that everything is in order and trying to protect your account against fraud or suspicious activity.<br>
            Alternatively it might be because you have not yet fulfilled the withdrawal conditions required for a promotion. Please check the Terms and Conditions for more information.<br>
            If you don’t believe this to be the case then feel free to get in touch and we’ll find out what’s going on!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>How do I deposit funds?</h3>
            <p>As part of the registration process you are asked to select a payment method to deposit funds on your account. This will enable you to top-up funds when required quickly and easily.<br>
            GBP (Pounds) is the account default currency. You are not able to change your selected currency on your account after registration. Gamevy Ltd will appear as a reference on your card or payment provider statement.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>How do I change my payment method?</h3>
            <p>To do this online, you can only change or update a payment method on your account when your balance is less than GBP 1.00 (£1.00) or EUR 1.00 (€1.00).<br>
            If you need to change your payment method when your account has more funds on it than this, please get in contact by phone and we will take you through the process. Sometimes, in order to protect you from fraud or theft, we might require further checks on any withdrawal.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>What happens during a disconnection?</h3>
            <p>All our games are played over Internet, and, in the case of mobile games, over the cellular mobile telephone networks. Sadly, these are not always perfect.<br>
            If you have not started the game when you are disconnected, the game will not take place.<br>
            If you have started the game when you are disconnected, the game will be recorded on the game servers and the bet will stand.<br>
            However, as soon as the problem is detected, Gamevy will ‘pause’ the game for a period of up to 24 hours. This means that when you return to the game, you should be able to continue playing – unless the disconnection occurred right at the moment of answering a question that could cause you to lose the game. If you do not return to the game within 24 hours, then the game will be considered lost.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>What happens during a time out?</h3>
            <p>Sometimes something happens that causes a distraction and you aren’t able to finish a move. We understand!<br>
            As soon as Gamevy detects a ‘time-out’ – that is, a period of inactivity – we will pause the game for up to 24 hours. This means that when you return to the game, you should be able to continue playing – unless the time-out occurred right at the moment of answering a question that could cause you to lose the game. If you do not return to the game within 24 hours, then the game will be considered lost.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>How do I know the games are fair?</h3>
            <p>We guarantee fair play at all times. We use a certified and audited Random Number Generator (RNG) to determine results around shuffles or symbol/ ball selection.<br>
            We use questions which offer a multiple choice answer. The questions are randomly selected from our question database. We use a high-quality independent company to generate these questions – all of which have been tested previously. If it turns out that one of the questions is wrong – and we agree that it’s wrong – then we’ll return your stake for that game.</p>

            <h3>I’m not happy – what do I do?</h3>
            <p>First of all give us a call or send us an email – we want you to enjoy playing our games and so we’d really like to know if something goes wrong. We aim to respond within 48 hours – but if there is a lengthy or complex investigation required then we will inform you of this and try to give a reasonable estimate of when we hope to have an answer or solution.<br>
            If we haven’t been able to resolve your query, then you can ask for the complaint to be escalated to another member of Gamevy’s team who will review the complaint and respond.<br>
            If this hasn’t satisfied your concern then you can contact the Independent Betting Adjudication Service (IBAS). Please note that IBAS needs you to have already contacted our Customer Support Team before they will look at your complaint.</p>
